      "Resumen: Se describe un nuevo algoritmo denominado \"el juego de fichas $(k,\\ell)$ con colores\", utilizado para caracterizar la familia de grafos $(k,\\ell)$-esparsos y proporcionar soluciones algorítmicas a problemas relacionados con descomposiciones arbóreas de grafos. Este tipo de grafos esparcidos tienen aplicaciones en la teoría de rigidez y han sido objeto de atención reciente. El método propuesto generaliza y refuerza resultados previos de Lee y Streinu, además de ofrecer una nueva demostración de la caracterización de la arboricidad por Tutte-Nash-Williams. También se presenta una nueva descomposición que certifica la esparcidad con base en el juego de fichas coloreadas, mostrando conexiones entre este enfoque y algoritmos previos sobre grafos esparsos.\n"
